# Translate Speech

The **Speech** service includes a **Speech translation** API that you can use to translate spoken language. For example, suppose you want to develop a translator application that people can use when traveling in places where they don't speak the local language. They would be able to say phrases such as "Where is the station?" or "I need to find a pharmacy" in their own language, and have it translate them to the local language.

> **Note**: This exercise requires that you are using a computer with a microphone and speakers/headphones.

## Clone the repository for this course

If you have not already done so, you must clone the code repository for this course:

1. Start Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and run a `Git: Clone` command to clone the `https://github.com/GraemeMalcolm/AI-102` repository to a local folder.
3. When the repository has been cloned, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
4. Wait while additional files are installed to support the C# code projects in the repo.

## Provision a Cognitive Services resource

If you don't already have on in your subscription, you'll need to provision a **Cognitive Services** resource.

1. Open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. Select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *cognitive services*, and create a **Cognitive Services** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Choose or create a resource group (if you are using a restricted subscription, you may not have permission to create a new resource group - use the one provided)*
    - **Region**: *Choose any available region*
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0
3. Select the required checkboxes and create the resource.
4. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.
5. When the resource has been deployed, go to it and view its **Keys and Endpoint** page. You will need one of the keys and the location in which the service is provisioned from this page in the next procedure.

## Prepare to use the Speech Translation service

In this exercise, you'll complete a partially implemented client application that uses the Speech SDK to recognize, translate, and synthesize speech.

> **Note**: You can choose to use the SDK for either **C#** or **Python**. In the steps below, perform the actions appropriate for your preferred language.

1. In Visual Studio Code open the **AI-102** project, and in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **08-speech-translation** folder and expand the **C-Sharp** or **Python** folder depending on your language preference.
2. Right-click the **translator** folder and open an integrated terminal. Then install the Speech SDK package by running the appropriate command for your language preference:

   **C#**

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech --version 1.14.0
    ```

   **Python**

   ```
   pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech==1.14.0
   ```

3. View the contents of the **translator** folder, and note that it contains a file for configuration settings:
    - **C#**: appsettings.json
    - **Python**: .env

    Open the configuration file and update the configuration values it contains to include an authentication **key** for your cognitive services resource, and the **location** where it is deployed. Save your changes.
4. Note that the **translator** folder contains a code file for the client application:

    - **C#**: Program.cs
    - **Python**: translator&period;py

    Open the code file and at the top, under the existing namespace references, find the comment **Import namespaces**. Then, under this comment, add the following language-specific code to import the namespaces you will need to use the Speech SDK:

    **C#**

    ```C#
    // Import namespaces
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Translation;
    ```

    **Python**

    ```Python
    # Import namespaces
    import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speech_sdk
    ```

5. In the **Main** function, note that code to load the cognitive services key and region from the configuration file has already been provided. You must use these variables to create a **SpeechTranslationConfig** for your cognitive services resource, which you will use to translate spoken input. Add the following code under the comment **Configure translation**:

    **C#**

    ```C#
    // Configure translation
    translationConfig = SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(cogSvcKey, cogSvcRegion);
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "en-US";
    translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage("fr");
    translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage("es");
    translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage("hi");
    Console.WriteLine("Ready to translate from " + translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage);
    ```

    **Python**

    ```Python
    # Configure translation
    translation_config = speech_sdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(cog_key, cog_region)
    translation_config.speech_recognition_language = 'en-US'
    translation_config.add_target_language('fr')
    translation_config.add_target_language('es')
    translation_config.add_target_language('hi')
    print('Ready to translate from',translation_config.speech_recognition_language)
    ```

6. You will use the **SpeechTranslationConfig** to translate speech into text, but you will also use a **SpeechConfig** to synthesize translations into speech. Add the following code under the comment **Configure speech**:

    **C#**

    ```C#
    // Configure speech
    speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription(cogSvcKey, cogSvcRegion);
    ```

    **Python**

    ```Python
    # Configure speech
    speech_config = speech_sdk.SpeechConfig(cog_key, cog_region)
    ```

7. Save your changes and return to the integrated terminal for the **translator** folder, and enter the following command to run the program:

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    **Python**

    ```
    python translator.py
    ```

8. If you are using C#, you can ignore any warnings about using the **await** operator in asynchronous methods - we'll fix that later. The code should display a message that it is ready to translate from en-US. Press ENTER to end the program.

## Implement speech translation

Now that you have a **SpeechTranslationConfig** for the speech service in your cognitive services resource, you can use the **Speech translation** API to recognize and translate speech.

1. In the **Main** function for your program, note that the code uses the **Translate** function to translate spoken input.
2. In the **Translate** function, under the comment **Translate speech**, add the following code to create a **TranslationRecognizer** client that can be used to recognize and translate speech using the default system microphone for input:

   **C#**

    ```C#
    // Translate speech
    using AudioConfig audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
    using TranslationRecognizer translator = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig, audioConfig);
    Console.WriteLine("Speak now...");
    TranslationRecognitionResult result = await translator.RecognizeOnceAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"Translating '{result.Text}'");
    translation = result.Translations[targetLanguage];
    Console.OutputEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;
    Console.WriteLine(translation);
    ```

    **Python**

    ```Python
    # Translate speech
    audio_config = speech_sdk.AudioConfig(use_default_microphone=True)
    translator = speech_sdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(translation_config, audio_config)
    print("Speak now...")
    result = translator.recognize_once_async().get()
    print('Translating "{}"'.format(result.text))
    translation = result.translations[targetLanguage]
    print(translation)
    ```

    > **Note**: *You can also translate speech input from an audio file by modifying the **AudioConfig** object to reference an file path.*

3. Save your changes and return to the integrated terminal for the **translator** folder, and enter the following command to run the program:

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    **Python**

    ```
    python translator.py
    ```

4. When prompted, enter a valid language code (*fr*, *es*, or *hi*), and then speak clearly into the microphone and say "where is the station?" or some other phrase you might use when traveling abroad. The program should transcribe your spoken input and translate it to the language you specified (French, Spanish, or Hindi). Repeat this process, trying each language supported by the application. When you're finished, press ENTER to end the program.

    > **Note** *The TranslationRecognizer gives you around 5 seconds to speak. If it detects no spoken input, it produces a "No match" result.*
    >
    > *The code in your application translates the input to all three languages in a single call. Only the translation for the specific language is displayed, but you can retrieve any of the translations by specifying the target language code in the **translations** collection of the result.*

## Synthesize the translation to speech

So far, your application translates spoken input to text; which might be sufficient if you need to ask someone for help while traveling. However, it would be better to have the translation spoken aloud in a suitable voice.

1. In the **Translate** function, under the comment **Synthesize translation**, add the following code to use a **SpeechSynthesizer** client to synthesize the translation as speech through the default speaker:

   **C#**

    ```C#
    // Synthesize translation
    var voices = new Dictionary<string, string>
                    {
                        ["fr"] = "fr-FR-Julie",
                        ["es"] = "es-ES-Laura",
                        ["hi"] = "hi-IN-Kalpana"
                    };
    speechConfig.SpeechSynthesisVoiceName = voices[targetLanguage];
    using SpeechSynthesizer speechSynthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig);
    SpeechSynthesisResult speak = await speechSynthesizer.SpeakTextAsync(translation);
    if (speak.Reason != ResultReason.SynthesizingAudioCompleted)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(speak.Reason);
    }
    ```

    **Python**

    ```Python
    # Synthesize translation
    voices = {
            "fr": "fr-FR-Julie",
            "es": "es-ES-Laura",
            "hi": "hi-IN-Kalpana"
    }
    speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name = voices.get(targetLanguage)
    speech_synthesizer = speech_sdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speech_config)
    speak = speech_synthesizer.speak_text_async(translation).get()
    if speak.reason != speech_sdk.ResultReason.SynthesizingAudioCompleted:
        print(speak.reason)
    ```

2. Save your changes and return to the integrated terminal for the **translator** folder, and enter the following command to run the program:

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    **Python**

    ```
    python translator.py
    ```

3. When prompted, enter a valid language code (*fr*, *es*, or *hi*), and then speak clearly into the microphone and say a phrase you might use when traveling abroad. The program should transcribe your spoken input and respond with a spoken translation. Repeat this process, trying each language supported by the application. When you're finished, press ENTER to end the program.

    > **Note** *In this example, you've used a **SpeechTranslationConfig** to translate speech to text, and then used a **SpeechConfig** to synthesize the translation as speech. You can in fact use the **SpeechTranslationConfig** to synthesize the translation directly, but this only works when translating to a single language, and results in an audio stream that is typically saved as a file rather than sent directly to a speaker.*

# Monitor Cognitive Services

Azure Cognitive Services can be a critical part of an overall application infrastructure. It's important to be able to monitor activity and get alerted to issues that may need attention.

## Provision a Cognitive Services resource

If you don't already have on in your subscription, you'll need to provision a **Cognitive Services** resource.

1. Open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. Select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *cognitive services*, and create a **Cognitive Services** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Choose or create a resource group (if you are using a restricted subscription, you may not have permission to create a new resource group - use the one provided)*
    - **Region**: *Choose any available region*
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0
3. Select the required checkboxes and create the resource.
4. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.
5. When the resource has been deployed, go to it and view its **Keys and Endpoint** page. Make a note of the endpoint URI - you will need it later.

## Configure an alert

Let's start by defining an alert rule so you can detect activity in your cognitive services resource.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your cognitive services resource and view its **Alerts** page (in the **Monitoring** section).
2. Select **+ New alert rule**
3. In the **Create alert rule** page, under **Scope**, verify that the your cognitive services resource is listed.
4. Under **Condition**, click **Select Condition**, and view the **Configure signal logic** pane that appears on the right, where you can select a signal type to monitor.
5. In the **signal type** list, select **Activity Log**, and then in the filtered list, select **List Keys**.
6. Review the activity over the past 6 hours, and then select **Done**.
7. Back in the **Create alert rule** page, under **Actions**, note that you can specify an *action group*. This enables you to configure automated actions when an alert is fired - for example, sending an email notification. We won't so that in this exercise; but it can be useful to do this in a production environment.
8. In the **Alert Details** section, set the **Alert rule name** to **Key List Alert**, and click **Create alert rule**. Wait for the alert rule to be created.
9. In Visual Studio Code, open a terminal and enter the following command to sign into your Azure subscription by using the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

    If you are not already signed in, a web browser will open and prompt you to sign into Azure. Do so, and then close the browser and return to Visual Studio Code.

    > **Tip**: If you have multiple subscriptions, you'll need to ensure that you are working in the one that contains your cognitive services resource.  Use this command to determine your current subscription.
    >
    > ```azurecli
    > az account show
    > ```
    >
    > If you need to change the subscription, run this command, changing *&lt;subscriptionName&gt;* to the correct subscription name.
    >
    > ```azurecli
    > az account set --subscription <subscriptionName>
    > ```

10. Now you can use the following command to get the list of cognitive services keys, replacing *&lt;resourceName&gt;* with the name of your cognitive services resource, and *&lt;resourceGroup&gt;* with the name of the resource group in which you created it.

    ```azurecli
    az cognitiveservices account keys list --name <resourceName> --resource-group <resourceGroup>
    ```

    The command returns a list of the keys for your cognitive services resource.

11. Switch back to the browser containing the Azure portal, and refresh your **Alert page**. You should see a **Sev 4** alert listed in the table (if not, wait a few minutes and refresh again).
12. Select the alert to see its details.

## Visualize a metric

As well as defining alerts, you can view metrics for your cognitive services resource to monitor its utilization.

1. In the Azure portal, in the page for your cognitive services resource, select **Metrics** (in the **Monitoring** section).
2. If there is no existing chart, select **+ New chart**. Then in the **Metric** list, review the possible metrics you can visualize and select **Total Calls**.
3. In the **Aggregation** list, select **Count**.  This will enable you to monitor the total calls to you Cognitive Service resource; which is useful in determining how much the service is being used over a period of time.
4. Switch back to Visual Studio Code, and in the terminal where you previously retrieved the keys for your resource, enter the following command (on a single line), replacing *&lt;yourEndpoint&gt;* and *&lt;yourKey&gt;* with your endpoint URI and **Key1** key to use the Text Analytics API in your cognitive services resource.

    ```curl
    curl -X POST "<yourEndpoint>/text/analytics/v3.0/languages?" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <yourKey>" --data-ascii "{'documents':[{'id':1,'text':'hello'}]}"
    ```

    The command returns a JSON document containing information about the language detected in the input data (which should be English).

5. Re-run the *curl* command multiple times to generate some call activity (you can use the **^** key to cycle through previous commands).
6. Return to the **Metrics** page in the Azure portal and refresh the **Total Calls** count chart. It may take a few minutes for the calls you made using *curl* to be reflected in the chart - keep refreshing the chart until it updates to include them.

## More information

One of the options for monitoring cognitive services is to use *diagnostic logging*. Once enabled, diagnostic logging captures rich information about your cognitive services resource usage, and can be a useful monitoring and debugging tool. It can take over an hour after setting up diagnostic logging to generate any information, which is why we haven't explored it in this exercise; but you can learn more about it in the [Cognitive Services documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/diagnostic-logging).

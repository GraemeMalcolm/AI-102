# Create a Bot with the Bot Framework SDK

*Bots* are software agents that can participate in conversational dialogs with human users. The Microsoft Bot Framework provides a comprehensive platform for building bots that can be delivered as cloud services through the Azure Bot Service.

In this exercise, you'll use the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK to create and deploy a bot.

## Clone the repository for this course

If you have not already done so, you must clone the code repository for this course:

1. Start Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and run a `Git: Clone` command to clone the `https://github.com/GraemeMalcolm/AI-102` repository to a local folder.
3. When the repository has been cloned, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
4. Wait while additional files are installed to support the C# code projects in the repo.

## Create a bot

You can use the Bot Framework SDK to create a bot based on a template, and then customize the code to meet your specific requirements.

> **Note**: In this exercise, you can choose to use the REST API from either **C#** or **Python**. In the steps below, perform the actions appropriate for your preferred language.

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **12-bot-framework** folder and expand the **C-Sharp** or **Python** folder depending on your language preference.
2. Right-click the folder for your chosen language and open an integrated terminal.
3. In the terminal, run the following commands to install the bot templates and packages you need:

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet new -i Microsoft.Bot.Framework.CSharp.EchoBot
    dotnet new -i Microsoft.Bot.Framework.CSharp.CoreBot
    dotnet new -i Microsoft.Bot.Framework.CSharp.EmptyBot
    ```

    **Python**

    ```
    pip install botbuilder-core
    pip install asyncio
    pip install aiohttp
    pip install cookiecutter==1.7.0
    ```

4. After the templates and packages have been installed, run the following command to create a bot based on the *EchoBot* template:

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet new echobot -n TimeBot
    ```

    **Python**

    ```
    cookiecutter https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-python/releases/download/Templates/echo.zip
    ```

    If you're using Python, when prompted by cookiecutter, enter the following details:
    - **bot_name**: TimeBot
    - **bot_description**: A bot for all time

5. In the terminal pane, enter the following commands to change the current directory to the **TimeBot** folder list the code files that have been generated for your bot:

    ```
    cd TimeBot
    dir
    ```

## Test the bot in the Bot Framework Emulator

You've created a bot based on the *EchoBot* template. Now you can run it locally and test it by using the Bot Framework Emulator.

1. In the terminal pane, ensure that the current directory is the **TimeBot** folder containing your bot code files, and then enter the following command to start your bot running locally.

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    **Python**

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

    When the bot starts, note the endpoint at which it is running is shown. This should be similar to `http://localhost:3978`.

2. Start the Bot Framework Emulator, and open your bot by specifying the endpoint with the `/api/messages` path appended, like this:

    `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

3. After the conversation is opened in a **Live chat** pane, wait for the message *Hello and welcome!*.
4. Enter a message such as *Hello* and view the response from the bot, which should echo back the message you entered.
5. Close the Bot Framework Emulator and return to Visual Studio Code, then in the terminal window, enter **CTRL+C** to stop the bot.

## Modify the bot code

You've created a bot that echoes the user's input back to them. It's not particularly useful, but serves to illustrate the basic flow of a conversational dialog. A conversation with a bot consists of a sequence of *activities*, in which text, graphics, or user interface *cards* are used to exchange information. The bot begins the conversation with a greeting, which is the result of a *conversation update* activity that is triggered when a user initializes a chat session with the bot. Then the conversation consists of a sequence of further activities in which the user and bot take it in turns to send *messages*.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the following code file for your bot:
    - **C#**: TimeBot/Bots/EchoBot.cs
    - **Python**: TimeBot/bot.py

    Note that the code in this file consists of *activity handler* functions; one for the *Member Added* conversation update activity (when someone joins the chat session) and another for the *Message* activity (when a message is received). The conversation is based on the concept of *turns*, in which each turn represents an interaction in which the bot receives, processes, and responds to an activity. The *turn context* is used to track information about the activity being processed in the current turn.

2. At the top of the code file, add the following namespace import statement:

    **C#**

    ```C#
    using System;
    ```

    **Python**

    ```Python
    from datetime import datetime
    ```

3. Modify the activity handler function for the *Message* activity to match the following code:

    **C#**

    ```C#
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        string inputMessage = turnContext.Activity.Text;
        string responseMessage = "Ask me what the time is.";
        if (inputMessage.ToLower()=="what is the time?")
        {
            var now = DateTime.Now;
            responseMessage = "The time is " + now.Hour.ToString() + ":" + now.Minute.ToString("D2");
        }
        await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text(responseMessage, responseMessage), cancellationToken);
    }
    ```

    **Python**

    ```Python
    async def on_message_activity(self, turn_context: TurnContext):
        input_message = turn_context.activity.text
        response_message = 'Ask me what the time is.'
        if input_message.lower() == 'what is the time?':
            now = datetime.now()
            response_message = 'The time is {}:{:02d}.'.format(now.hour,now.minute)
        await turn_context.send_activity(response_message)
    ```

4. Save your changes, and then in the terminal pane, ensure that the current directory is the **TimeBot** folder containing your bot code files, and then enter the following command to start your bot running locally.

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    **Python**

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

    As before, when the bot starts, note the endpoint at which it is running is shown. This should be similar to `http://localhost:3978`.

5. Start the Bot Framework Emulator, and open your bot by specifying the endpoint with the `/api/messages` path appended, like this:

    `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

6. After the conversation is opened in a **Live chat** pane, wait for the message *Hello and welcome!*.
7. Enter a message such as *Hello* and view the response from the bot, which should be *Ask me what the time is*.
8. Enter *What is the time?* and view the response.

    The bot now responds to the query "What is the time?" by displaying the local time where the bot is running. For any other query, it prompts the user to ask it what the time is. This is a fairly limited bot, which could be improved through integration with the Language Understanding service and additional custom code, but it serves as a working example of how you can build a solution with the Bot Framework SDK by extending a bot created from a template.

9. Close the Bot Framework Emulator and return to Visual Studio Code, then in the terminal window, enter **CTRL+C** to stop the bot.

## Deploy the bot to Azure

Now you're ready to deploy your bot to Azure. Deployment involves multiple steps to prepare the code for deployment and create the necessary Azure resources.

### Create or select a resource group

A bot relies on multiple Azure resources, which can be created in a single resource group.

1. Open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. View the **Resource Groups** page to see the resource groups that exist in your subscription.
3. If you are using a "sandbox" subscription that restricts you to an existing resource group, note the resource group name. Otherwise use the **&#65291;Add** button to create a new resource group with a unique name in any available region.

### Create an Azure application registration

Your bot needs an application registration to enable it to communicate with users and web services.

1. In the terminal window for your **TimeBot** folder, enter the following command to use the Azure command line interface (CLI) to log into Azure.

    ```
    az login
    ```

    When a browser opens, sign into your Azure subscription.

2. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, enter the following command to select the subscription in which you want to deploy the bot.

    ```
    az account set --subscription "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME>"
    ```

3. Enter the following command to create an application registration for **TimeBot** with the password **Super$ecretPassw0rd** (you can use an alternative display name and password if you wish, but make a note of them - you'll need them later).

    ```
    az ad app create --display-name "TimeBot" --password "Super$ecretPassw0rd" --available-to-other-tenants
    ```

4. When the command completes, a large JSON response is displayed. In this response, find the **appId** value and make a note of it. You will need it in the next procedure.

### Create Azure resources

When you use the Bot Framework SDK to create a bot from a template, the Azure Resource Manager templates necessary to create the required Azure resources are provided for you.

1. In the terminal pane for your **TimeBot** folder, enter the following command (on a single line), replacing the \<PLACEHOLDER\> values as follows:
    - **\<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP\>**: The name of your existing resource group.
    - **\<YOUR_APP_ID\>**: The **appId** value you noted in the previous procedure.
    - **\<REGION\>**: An Azure region code (such as *eastus*).
    - **All other placeholders**: Unique values that will be used to name the new resources. In particular, make a note of the value you use for the **BotId** and **newWebAppName** parameters - you will need them later.

    ```
    az deployment group create --resource-group "<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP>" --template-file "deploymenttemplates/template-with-preexisting-rg.json" --parameters appId="<YOUR_APP_ID>" appSecret="Super$ecretPassw0rd" botId="<A_UNIQUE_BOT_ID>" newWebAppName="<A_UNIQUE_WEB_APP_NAME>" newAppServicePlanName="<A_UNIQUE_PLAN_NAME>" appServicePlanLocation="<REGION>" --name "<A_UNIQUE_SERVICE_NAME>"
    ```

2. Wait for the command to complete. If it is successful, a JSON response will be displayed.

    If an error occurs, it may be caused by a typo in the command or a unique naming conflict with an existing resource. Correct the issue and try again. You may need to use the Azure portal to delete any resources that were created before the failure occurred.

3. After the command has completed, view your resource group in the Azure portal to see the resources that have been created.

### Prepare the bot code for deployment

Now that you have the required Azure resources in place, you can prepare your code for deployment to them.

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the terminal pane for your **TimeBot** folder, enter the following command to prepare your code's dependencies for deployment.

    **C#**

    ```
    az bot prepare-deploy --lang Csharp --code-dir "." --proj-file-path "TimeBot.csproj"
    ```

    **Python**

    > *Python dependencies are managed on the deployment target through the inclusion of a `requirements.txt` file in the folder containing the code files. In this case, there are no package dependencies, so there is not need to create a requirements file*

2. In Visual Studio Code, in the terminal pane for your **TimeBot** folder, enter the following command to package your code files in a zip for deployment.

    ```
    powershell Compress-Archive * TimeBot.zip
    ```

### Deploy and test the bot

Now that your code is prepared, you can deploy it.

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the terminal pane for your **TimeBot** folder, enter the following command (on a single line) to deploy your packaged code files, replacing the \<PLACEHOLDER\> values as follows:
    - **\<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP\>**: The name of your existing resource group.
    - **\<YOUR_WEB_APP_NAME\>**: The unique name you specified for the **newWebAppName** parameter when creating Azure resources.

    ```
    az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group "<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP>" --name "<YOUR_WEB_APP_NAME>" --src "TimeBot.zip"
    ```

2. In the Azure portal, in the resource group containing your resources, open the **Bot Channels Registration** resource (which will have the name you assigned to the **BotId** parameter when creating Azure resources).
3. In the **Bot management** section, select **Test in Web Chat**. Then wait for your bot to initialize and display the message *Hello and welcome!*.
4. Enter a message such as *Hello* and view the response from the bot, which should be *Ask me what the time is*.
5. Enter *What is the time?* and view the response.

## Explore bot channels

One of the key benefits of the Azure Not Service is the ability to deliver your bot through multiple *channels*.

1. In the Azure portal, on the page where you were previously testing your Bot, select **Channels**.
2. Note that the **Web Chat** channel has been added automatically, and that other channels for common communication platforms are available.
3. Next to the **Web Chat** channel, click **Edit**. This opens a page with the settings you need to embed your bot in a web page. To embed your bot, you need the HTML embed code provided as well as one of the secret keys generated for your bot.
4. Copy the **Embed code**.
5. In Visual Studio Code, expand the **12-bot-framework/web-client** folder and select the **default.html** file it contains.
6. In the HTML code, paste the embed code you copied directly beneath the comment **add the iframe for the bot here**
7. Back in the Azure portal, select **Show** for one of your secret keys (it doesn't matter which one), and copy it. Then return to Visual Studio Code and paste it in the HTML embed code you added previously, replacing `YOUR_SECRET_HERE`.
8. In Visual Studio Code, in the **Explorer** pane, right-click **default.html** and select **Reveal in File Explorer**.
9. In the File Explorer window, open **default.html** in Microdoft Edge.
10. In the web page that opens, test the bot by entering *Hello*. Note that it won't initialize until you submit a message, so the greeting message will be followed immediately by a prompt to ask what the time is.
11. Test the bot by submitting *What is the time?*.
